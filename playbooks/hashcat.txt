summary:
Hashcat allows a obtained credential hash to be brute forced via a wordlist

commands:
hashcat <file containing hash> <wordlist e.g. rockyou.txt>
# hashcat may complain if it cannot figure out the hash type, it will give you some options
# to try. The hash type can be selected with the -m switch, e.g.
hashcat -m 0 <file containing hash> /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
# the above sets the hashtype to md5
