summary:
If a webapp takes user inputs, it will often have a database on the backend.
This database may poorly configured, or, the webapp may not properly sanitize inputs.
This lack of input sanitization can lead to sql injection (sqli) vulnerabilities.
These can be detected and exploited by sqlmap.

commands:
# dump contents of databases via forms, accept all defaults when sqlmap asks.
sqlmap -u http://<ip address> --forms --dump
